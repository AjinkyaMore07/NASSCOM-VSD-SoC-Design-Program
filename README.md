DAY1
    Processor/SoC:

    The central part of the system, which handles computation, control, and data processing. In a System on Chip (SoC), the processor integrates with various components like memory, interfaces, and other peripherals to create a complete system

    JTAG, UART0, QSPI1, I2C0, clk, reset (Left Side):

    A] JTAG (Joint Test Action Group): Used for debugging and testing the chip during development.

    B] UART0 (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter): A serial communication protocol for transmitting and receiving data between devices.

    C] QSPI1 (Quad Serial Peripheral Interface): A flash memory interface that communicates at high speeds.

    D] I2C0 (Inter-Integrated Circuit): A multi-master, multi-slave protocol used for communication between integrated circuits.

    E] clk: The clock signal that synchronizes operations across the chip.

    F] reset: Resets the system to a predefined state.
