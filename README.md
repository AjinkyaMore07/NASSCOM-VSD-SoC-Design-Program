What is Foundry , Lithiography system , Photolithiography
    
1] Foundry

a] Definition:
        
        A foundry is a manufacturing facility where silicon wafers are processed to fabricate integrated circuits (ICs). These facilities use highly specialized equipment to create semiconductor devices based on designs provided by fabless semiconductor companies.

b] Function:
        
        The primary role of a foundry is to produce ICs by following a set of fabrication steps that include deposition, etching, doping, and photolithography.
        Foundries do not design chips themselves but manufacture them based on specifications provided by their clients (fabless companies).

    Examples of Foundries:
        TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), Samsung Foundry, and GlobalFoundries are well-known semiconductor foundries.

c] Importance:
        
        Foundries are essential to the semiconductor industry, as they allow fabless companies to focus on design, leaving manufacturing to specialized facilities. This separation of design and production enables faster innovation and cost savings.

        

2] Lithography System

a] Definition:
        
        A lithography system is a machine used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to transfer intricate circuit patterns from a mask (or reticle) onto the surface of a silicon wafer using light or another form of energy.

b] Types of Lithography:
        
        Optical Lithography: Uses ultraviolet (UV) light to pattern wafers.
        Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography: Uses extremely short wavelengths of light (13.5 nm) to achieve finer resolution in advanced nodes like 7nm or below.
        
        Electron Beam Lithography: Uses a focused beam of electrons to write patterns directly on the wafer, commonly used for prototype or low-volume production.

c] Components:
        
        Light Source: Generates light or energy beams (e.g., UV or EUV light).
        Mask/Reticle: Contains the pattern to be transferred to the wafer.
        Projection Lens: Focuses and reduces the image of the mask onto the wafer surface.

d] Importance:
        
        Lithography is a critical step in defining the size and shape of the circuit features on a chip. As semiconductor technology advances, achieving smaller, more precise features becomes increasingly difficult, making improvements in lithography systems essential.

        

3] Photolithography

a] Definition:
      
        Photolithography is a process used in semiconductor manufacturing to transfer geometric shapes from a photomask to the surface of a silicon wafer using light. It is a key part of the IC fabrication process, allowing patterns to be etched into the wafer to form transistors, interconnects, and other components.


b] Steps in Photolithography: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4f69868-b41f-4136-b16c-48788612a9e8)

        
        1] Coating the Wafer: A layer of photoresist (a light-sensitive material) is applied to the wafer's surface.
        2] Exposure: The wafer is exposed to light through a mask, which contains the circuit pattern. The light causes chemical changes in the exposed parts of the photoresist.
        3] Development: The exposed wafer is developed, washing away either the exposed or unexposed parts of the photoresist (depending on whether a positive or negative photoresist is used).
        4] Etching: The pattern created by the remaining photoresist is used as a stencil to etch the desired patterns into the wafer.
        5] Removal: The remaining photoresist is removed, leaving the etched pattern on the wafer.

c] Types of Photoresist:
        
        1] Positive Photoresist: The exposed areas of the photoresist become soluble and are removed during development.
        2] Negative Photoresist: The exposed areas become insoluble and remain after development, while the unexposed areas are removed.

d] Importance:
        
        Photolithography is critical for creating the small, intricate patterns on a silicon wafer that define a chip's functionality. It determines the feature size of transistors, interconnects, and other components, which directly affects the performance and power consumption of the final IC

# Stopwatch Application Workflow : 


![apps_to_hardware](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/556b3dd8-3836-4ff2-8f08-7ca66807fa9b)


This project shows the flow of a Stopwatch application from the user's interaction to hardware execution. The flow is divided into three main stages: **Application Software**, **System Software**, and **Hardware**.

## 1. Application Software (Stopwatch App)

### Example:
The Stopwatch application, running on a laptop or computer, allows users to interact with the system through simple actions such as:
- **Start**
- **Pause**
- **Reset**

### Functionality:
This application serves as the interface for the user, taking input commands and performing tasks like starting, pausing, or resetting the timer.

---

## 2. System Software

The system software bridges the application software and the hardware, ensuring smooth communication and efficient resource management.

### Components:
- **Operating System (OS):**
  - The OS manages key system resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.
  - It is responsible for running the stopwatch application while handling background tasks like I/O operations and memory allocation.
  - Common operating systems include macOS, Windows, and Linux.

- **Compiler:**
  - The compiler translates the high-level code (e.g., C, C++, Java) from the application software into machine-level instructions.
  - These instructions are packaged into an executable file (e.g., `.exe` for Windows).

- **Assembler:**
  - The assembler takes the compiler-generated instructions and converts them into binary machine code (e.g., `1010100101...`).
  - This machine code consists of low-level instructions that can be directly executed by the hardware.

---

## 3. Hardware

Once the machine code is prepared, the hardware executes it.

### Components:
- **Processor:**
  - The processor executes the machine code instructions and performs the necessary operations, such as updating the stopwatch display or starting/stopping the timer.

- **Digital Circuits:**
  - Supporting components, such as clocks (`Clk`), inputs (`Din`), and outputs (`Dout`), help manage data flow and timing during execution.

---

## Summary of the Flow:

1. The **user** interacts with the Stopwatch application (Application Software).
2. The **operating system** (System Software) manages resources and communicates between the app and the hardware.
3. The **compiler** translates high-level code (C, C++, Java) into low-level instructions.
4. The **assembler** converts these instructions into binary machine code.
5. The **hardware** executes the binary instructions to perform tasks like displaying the stopwatch or updating the time.
